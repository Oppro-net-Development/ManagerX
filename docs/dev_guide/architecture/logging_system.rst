Logging System
=================

The **Logging System** in ManagerX is a crucial component that handles the recording and management of log messages generated by the bot during its operation. It provides developers and administrators with insights into the bot's behavior, performance, and any issues that may arise.

Architecture
-------------------------

The Logging System is designed to capture log messages from various parts of the bot, including command execution, event handling, and system operations. It categorizes logs based on severity levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and formats them for easy readability.

Key Features
-------------------------

- **Centralized Logging:** All log messages are routed through a central logging handler, ensuring consistency in log formatting and storage.
- **Multiple Log Levels:** Supports various log levels to filter messages based on their importance, allowing developers to focus on critical issues or debug information as needed.
- **File and Console Output:** Logs can be directed to both console output for real-time monitoring and log files for persistent storage and later analysis.
- **Timestamping:** Each log entry is timestamped, providing context for when events occurred. 
- **Custom Log Handlers:** Supports custom log handlers for specialized logging needs, such as sending logs to external monitoring services or databases.
- **Rotating Log Files:** Implements log rotation to manage log file sizes and prevent disk space exhaustion.

Usage
-------------------------

Developers can utilize the Logging System by importing the logging module and using predefined loggers to record messages at various levels. The system is configurable, allowing for adjustments to log levels and output formats as needed.

Example
-------------------------

.. code-block:: python
    from logs import logger, LogLevel, Category, LogFormat


    # Log messages at different levels
    logger.debug(Category.DEBUG, "This is a debug message.")
    logger.info(Category.INFO, "Bot started successfully.")
    logger.warning(Category.API, "This is a warning message.")
    logger.error(Category.COMMAND, "An error occurred during command execution.")
    logger.critical(Category.API, "Critical issue! Immediate attention required.")

The Logging System is an essential part of ManagerX's architecture, providing robust logging capabilities that enhance the bot's maintainability and debuggability. Its design focuses on flexibility, clarity, and ease of use, making it a valuable tool for developers and administrators alike.
