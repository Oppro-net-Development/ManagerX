Architecture
====================
Architecture of ManagerX.
ManagerX is built with a modular architecture that emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and ease of development. The core components of the architecture include the event loop, command handler, database handler, cog system, logging system, and error handling mechanisms.
Each component is designed to handle specific responsibilities, allowing developers to work on individual parts of the bot without affecting the overall system. This modular approach facilitates collaboration among developers and enables the addition of new features with minimal disruption.
