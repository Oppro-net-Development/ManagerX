# You need to install Sphinx with `pip install sphinx` and these extensions to build the docs
pydata-sphinx-theme      # for a modern documentation theme
sphinx-autodoc-typehints # for better type hinting support
myst-parser              # for Markdown support
sphinx-copybutton        # adds copy buttons to code blocks
sphinx-autobuild         # optional: live preview during development
                         # (remove this before pushing; ReadTheDocs doesn't need it)
